    <p>Here we check for all receivers and all defined algorithms whether the signal reaches a certain minimum value or not and we sum up all which reach this minimum value. 
        In addition, we sum up the used amplitude factor 'a' of the senders for each algorithm, 
        which can be seen in the top legend of the plot. We compare all defined and all working algorithms. 
        The positions of the senders and receivers are the same for all algorithms.</p>

    <h5><u><b>Number</b></u></h5>
    <p> You can set the <b>random seed</b> which influences the position of the <b>senders</b> and <b>receivers</b>, 
        so that <b>senders</b> and <b>receivers</b> always have the same position with the same number of <b>senders</b>, <b>receivers</b> and same <b>random seed</b>.
        The required calculation factor is shown under <b>Log10(calculation) </b>and cannot take a value above 9.
    </p>

    <h5><u><b>Receiver Positions</b></u></h5>
    <p>With <b>Formation</b> you can choose in which form the receivers are distributed, 3d sphere, 2d horizontal disc, 2d vertical disc. 
        <b>X,Y,Z</b> are the coordinates of the origin of the choosen shape and 
        <b>Radius</b> the corresponding radius in which the receiver are randomly distributed.</p>

    <h5><u><b>Parameters</b></u></h5>

    <p>With <b>isotropic</b> you can decide whether a sender sends equally in all directions or not. See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic_radiator">Isotropic radiator</a>,
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna#Hertzian_dipole">Dipole antenna</a></p>

    <p><b>Path loss, Wavelength</b> and <b>b</b> are parameters of the <a href="/documentation/model">model</a>.
        The parameters <b>Wavelength</b> and <b>b</b> are passed to the  <a href="/documentation/algorithms">algorithms</a>.</p>

    <h5><u><b>Plot Settings</b></u></h5>

    <p><b>Min signal value</b> gives the minimum signal value at which a receiver must be reached in order to be counted.</p>

    <p>With <b>Signal</b> you can choose which part of the received signal must exceed the minimum signal value. 
        For example, only the imaginary part or only the real one.</p>

    <p><b>Plot Range</b> specifies the range in which is added to the minimum signal value and within which it is checked whether the receivers reach the minimum.</p>


    <p>You can set the <b>ignore receiver in origin radius</b> so that all receivers that are within the selected radius from the origin (0,0,0) are not counted in the plot.</p>

    <h5><u><b>Simulate</b></u></h5>

    <p>
        Each algorithm is simulated and then the plot is created.
        If only values ​​under plot sessings are changed, the algorithms are not re-simulated but the changes are applied to the plot.</p>
